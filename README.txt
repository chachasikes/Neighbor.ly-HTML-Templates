This is the base theme for Neighborly.

Hosted on github:

The theme consists of a main page template, css, and some php functions that return form elements and some dynamic graphics.

It is based on the 960 grid layout (20 columns, 20px wide with a 10px gutter.)
http://960.gs/

Tiles:
There are regions for the tiles in the template. These tiles will live in a directory, and will be randomly placed.
The tiles consist of 'people' and 'connections' and when displayed will alternate 'person, connection, person, connection.'
The tiles can be visible in any of the regions, top, botton, left, right.

Javascript:
The jQuery 1.4 and jQuery UI libraries have been added.
The jQuery UI library is the full export, as decisions are made, a smaller library can be made available.

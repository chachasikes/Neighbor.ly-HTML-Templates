Hosted on github:

The theme consists of a main page template, css, and some php functions that return form elements and some dynamic graphics.

It is based on the 960 grid layout (20 columns, 20px wide with a 10px gutter.)

Javascript:
The jQuery 1.4 and jQuery UI libraries have been added.
The jQuery UI library is the full export, as decisions are made, a smaller library can be made available.
